## Making :point_down:

This flutter application is totally responsive. When we change the orientation the app fits in that. I have used [FLUTTER](https://flutter.dev/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw38-DBhDpARIsADJ3kjliHdMH2hA97bBGqJtW5ORUUksCxpZ8cnrSWaH__HevGftAmP8AmvIaAhNlEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/) in front end and backend. I have designed this using [Materials ui](https://material-ui.com/). I have created database using [sql](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) where the notes are kept in table. I have loaded the entire app in main.dart.
